      <description>Welcome back to Part 2 of the GitHub series. Now, we create a text file named index.txt and add a line in the text file for example print(“hello!”). Now perform the previous command again: 
git status  After this command, It will display some message stating untracked files meaning that some changes have been made to this folder which is not tracked by git yet and it is red marked.</description>
